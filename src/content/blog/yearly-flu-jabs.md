I recently got the flu and the loss in productivity is making me consider getting a yearly flu jab

**Productivity Impact Without the Flu Jab:**

	- **Flu Incidence:** Assume a coinflip (>50%) of catching the flu annually.
 - **Productivity Loss:**
   - 2–4 days of no productivity due to illness.
   - 2–6 days of diminished productivity (25%).
   - **Total productivity loss:** ~4 days per flu episode (on average).



**Productivity Impact With the Flu Jab:**

- **Reduced Risk of Flu:** 40–60% lower chance of getting the flu.
- **If You Catch the Flu:**
  - 1–2 days of no productivity.
  - 1 day of diminished productivity (25%).
  - **Total productivity loss if flu occurs:** ~1.25 days (on average).



**Flu Jab Productivity Cost:**

- Virtually none (most people experience no significant side effects).



**Comparison of Yearly Outcomes:**

**Without Flu Jab:**

- ~50% chance of ~4 days lost productivity = ~2 days/year (expected value).

**With Flu Jab:**

- ~20–30% chance of ~1.25 days lost productivity = ~0.25–0.375 days/year.

  

  **Net gain:** ~1.5–1.75 days of productivity/year.



If you’re in a high-productivity role or value your time significantly, the flu jab is a **low-cost, high-return decision.** The math supports getting the vaccine if your annual risk of flu exceeds ~40–60% (which it likely does in most social or workplace settings). The additional safety and reduced risk of complications further strengthen its value.
