## Virtual Reality

Virtual reality is rapidly shaping up as a way to enhance and equalize access to certain spaces. As I write this, I’m in a virtual workspace with a pleasant view—not awe-inspiring, but still a clear improvement over my regular setup. Around me are virtual coworkers, which pushes me to work harder and for longer—the classic Starbucks effect. What’s remarkable is how small improvements like this can create a compounding advantage over time, all at a relatively low cost. It’s not flashy or groundbreaking in the moment, but it’s effective. This is where I see VR going in the future: not just as a tool for immersion but as a quiet, consistent way to level up daily life.

this is firmly how I feel about the future.

## Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence will continue to drive a wedge between those who use and understand it and those who don’t. This divide is already visible. As of right now access to compute is roughly equal regardless of typical causes of inequality.

Already we can see this in a recent study[^1] AI already beats out doctors at diagnosis, it also performs about on par with them on therapy[^2] - It can also help in school environments (even when not just used for cheating)[^3] - Now this is just looking at general use, $20 a month chatGPT - imagine how much has yet to be seen, imagine the advantage of an AI that can already go and search a bunch of news sites for you and answer follow up questions abotu it, an AI that already is on par with therapists and can diagnose illnesses better than a doctor - This is before companies have even tried to make it good at these things - Imagine just the question of GPT, how much of an advantage does someone have by having and using it?


This is just one piece of transformative technology. If history is any guide, these types of tools aren’t just going to become more common—they’re going to become more essential. The gap between adopters and everyone else will widen, and for those paying attention, the benefits will compound, just like with VR.

As these technologies mature, the gap between users and non-users will become even more pronounced. This isn’t just about having better tools—it’s about fundamentally changing how we approach problems and opportunities. Those leveraging VR and AI will operate on a different level of efficiency and creativity. A person working in a virtual office with an AI assistant doesn’t just gain incremental improvements—they’re playing an entirely different game. They can process more information, make faster decisions, and build environments tailored for peak performance.

This kind of compounding advantage creates a new kind of digital literacy divide, where the skills to navigate and integrate these tools into daily life determine success.

What’s fascinating is how these advancements build on each other. A person who learns to use AI effectively will likely integrate VR to enhance their workflow. Someone comfortable with VR workspaces will find new ways to incorporate AI tools into that environment. This isn’t about flashy, one-off innovations; it’s about a systemic shift in how we function.

As time goes on, these technologies won’t just feel transformative—they’ll become invisible, woven into the fabric of daily life. That’s when the real change happens. The tools become less about novelty and more about necessity, and the people who’ve mastered them will be light-years ahead of those who haven’t even started. For those paying attention now, the compounding effect is already in motion.
